# Design Pattern in Python

This repository contains the code to learn design pattern in python.
The goal of this repository is to make the reader had an ability to determine
what pattern to use when they faced a problem.
I hope this repository can help the reader to understand the pattern and apply it in their real world problem.

Each folder contains the code for each design pattern. inside each folder, there are 2 sub-folder:

- `before`: contains the code before applying the design pattern
- `after`: contains the code after applying the design pattern

In each pattern folder, there is a `readme.md` file that contains the explanation of the pattern,
real world scenarios, and the code before and after applying the pattern.
There are a clear point of what problem that the pattern solve and how the pattern solve the problem.

To be able to follow each pattern, I recommend to read the pattern with this order:

#### Creational Patterns

1. [Factory Method](factory_method/readme.md)
